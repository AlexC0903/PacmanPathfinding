# Pathfinding Visualizer With Python

Simple pathfinding visualizer build with python, for fun and for school. 
I used Pygame for graphics, and the Queue library that is automatically installed with Python3.7+.

## Dependencies:
Python 3.7+ and Pygame is required.
```
pip install pygame
```

The prototype was created with the help of this youtube video by TechWithTim:
