# Pathfinding Visualizer With Python

Simple pathfinding visualizer build with python, for fun and for school. 
In the future, I might move the graphics of this project over to PyQt5 or to WPF(C#)

## Dependencies:
Python 3.7+ and Pygame is required.
```
pip install pygame
```

Project is indebted to this video by TechWithTim:
